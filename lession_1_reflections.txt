1.How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

	Viewing the diff allowed me to see exactly which lines changed by comparing and seeing where the differences were.

2. How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

	You could go back to previous versions and revert. You could make changes without fear knowing you can always go back if necessary.

3. What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when you create a commit, like you do in Git, vs. having version automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

	Manually committing allows you to choose exactly what is in each commit. However, you are also relying on yourself to remember to commit at the proper times. If you forget to commit you are risking your changes.

4. Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others llike Google Docs treat each file separately?

	Git is designed more for projects with multiple files in mind for SW developement. Google Docs is more designed for individual documents over a collection of docs.

5. How can you use the commands git log and get diff to view the history of files?

	Log shows you list of all commits and get diff shows you the differences between each commit.

6. How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

	You can always revert back to a previous version 

7. Now that oyu have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

	Version control for classroom and current projects
