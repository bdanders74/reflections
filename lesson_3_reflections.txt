1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When you are working with multiple people. 
  When you want an offsite backup.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	What if changes are made that you don't want to incorporate into your local repository?

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Forks: a clone on github. Could be from your own repository or someone else's repository you have rights to.
	Clone: Copy a repository from one location to another. Could be locally, remotely or some combo of these.
	Branch: Add a commit different from the master branch.

4. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	So you have the most recent remote copy available for use offline. Plus then you dont have to download it each time you want to look at it.

5. How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier and what would be harder?
	Email and pushing full project directories around
	Easier: Nothing
	Harder: Version control. How do you know what is up to date?
			Multiple copies floating around
