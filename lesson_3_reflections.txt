1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When you are working with multiple people. 
  When you want an offsite backup.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	What if changes are made that you don't want to incorporate into your local repository?
