1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When you are working with multiple people. 
  When you want an offsite backup.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	What if changes are made that you don't want to incorporate into your local repository?

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Forks: a clone on github. Could be from your own repository or someone else's repository you have rights to.
	Clone: Copy a repository from one location to another. Could be locally, remotely or some combo of these.
	Branch: Add a commit different from the master branch.
